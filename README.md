## About Me

Recent Information Systems graduate seeking entry level DevOps, SecOps, or related roles to apply my hands on experience with Kubernetes, cloud infrastructure, and automation. I have experience with containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, and cloud provisioning across Azure, GCP, and AWS, with foundational knowledge in cybersecurity best practices.

## Featured Project

### Home IoT Monitoring System

Built a complete IoT system that collects sensor data from custom Raspberry Pi Pico W devices and processes it through Azure cloud services. The project demonstrates practical cloud infrastructure management and real-time data processing. I split the work into two repositories - one for the Azure backend and one for the sensor firmware.

**Technologies:** Azure App Service, Terraform, Azure Data Lake, Databricks, C# .NET, MicroPython, Raspberry Pi Pico W, Azure Key Vault

#### What I Built:
- Azure cloud infrastructure using Terraform for consistent deployments
- RESTful API in C# .NET deployed to Azure App Service for data ingestion
- Automated data storage pipeline to Azure Data Lake with structured folder organization
- Databricks workspace for data analysis with custom Python notebooks
- MicroPython firmware for Pico W with temperature and humidity sensors
